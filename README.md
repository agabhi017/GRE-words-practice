# GRE-words-practice

This is a simple app developed using MIT's app inventor 2. The objective is to create a simple construct which allows revision of words for the preparation towards the GRE exam. The list of words and their meanings can be given by the user via google sheets and the app allows the user to revise certain number of random words at a time. You can either choose to access the project file and modify as per your requirements (number of random words at a time or the list of words to revise) or download the apk and access the pre-loaded list of words(courtsey - Magoosh). This gives the flexibility to practice the words as deemed fit, for example some of us can focus more on the difficult words while others can revise the whole array of 1000-1500 words. The motivation behind this was the unavailabilty of a flexible application which can help the users to practice/revise the words as per their progress and convenience. Given that the words are shown in the format of flashcards, it gives the freedom to open the app and learn the words at any convenient time. Being a full time employee myself, I would prefer to glance through the words based on my overall progress whenever time permits (for example, during lunch breaks or shuffling between meetings etc.). Moreover, it has inbuilt functionality to google search for a word to check its meaning or usage in a sentence.

# Screens

It is a 2 screen app :
1. The first screen shows the list of words and a refresh button to refresh the list
2. The second screen features the meaning of the selected word and 1-click google search
