# GRE-words-practice
This is a simple app developed using MIT's app inventor 2. The objective is to create a simple construct which allows revision of words for the preparation towards the GRE exam. The list of words and their meanings can be given by the user via google sheets and the app allows the user to revise certain number of random words at a time. You can either choose to access the project file and modify the number of words for an iteration or download the apk and access the pre-loaded list of words(courtsey - Magoosh). This gives the flexibility to practice the words as deemed fit, for example some of us can focus more on the difficult words while others can revise the whole array of 1000-1500 words. The motivation behind this was the inavailabilty of a flexible application which can help the users to practice/revise the words as per their progress and convenience. Given that the words are shown in the format of flashcards, it gives the freedom to open the app and learn the words at any convenient time.
